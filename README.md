## Goal
I find the small details in my environment fascinatingâ€”those mundane features of our world that often go overlooked. I love to dwell on the possibilities beyond their intended use, transforming something ordinary to something that's extraordinary.

This interaction explores the concept of 'what if a city could breathe?,' inviting viewers to observe closely and imagine if they could see it happening.
